# Project Custom Instructions

## Coding Review Guidelines

When reviewing code, focus on the following points:

- Use of Latest GitHub Actions Features
  - Consider using the latest features of GitHub Actions, such as reusable workflows and composite actions.
  - Follow general GitHub Actions best practices.
    - Ensure proper naming conventions for workflows and actions.
    - Optimize workflow performance.
    - Maintain security best practices.

Suggest fixes for any sections that deviate from these points.

## Documentation Review Guidelines

When reviewing changes to documentation, focus on the following points:

- Spelling
- Clarity and Conciseness
  - Ensure the content is written in a clear and concise manner.
- Headings
  - Check that appropriate headings are used.
- Documentation Style
  - The writing style must be consistent with existing documentation.
  - Documentation is not a personal blog post. The subject is the project itself, and the project provides content to the reader.
- Sample Code
  - Verify that the code works correctly and maintains quality.
  - Ensure the code follows general .NET coding guidelines (e.g., naming conventions).

If any part deviates from these points, propose a correction.
